# Project 3 - Linked List
You will create a linked list data structure by filling in the specific functions that are empty.  You will use a templated linked list so you can store any value type.

## Part 1
1. linkedlist.hpp is the header which defines the linkedlist itself and contains the implementation.
2. Fill in all the functions in linkedlist.hpp.  This includes error handling by throwing exceptions on the documented conditions.
3. You will always use the LinkedListException class for Exceptions.  Return an error message appropriate to the error.
4. You need to make sure that _head, _tail, and _size are always correct.
5. You will use the Node class provided to implement the linked list.
## Testing
1. Run "make test" to test the linkedlist class to see if it works.
2. Run "make testdebug" to get debug messages while testing the class.
3. lltest.txt contains the list of tests.  You can add new tests yourself or it will indicate where in the file the tests failed and what was expected.
4. You are responsible for ensuring the class always works as the test cases are not exhaustive.
5. You DO NOT need to handle out of memory errors.
## Extra Credit
1. There are additional functions you can fill in for extra credit.  They are called out explicitly and are a bit more challenging.
